WELCOME
Hello and thank you for visiting my Capstone project for the Flatiron School. My name is AlgorithmicJason and you are visiting my full-stack application called MyBrain. 

IDEA BEHIND MYBRAIN
The reason for making this application is because i needed a tool to remember little details in programming that i might not use everyday. MyBrain helps me track what i've learned and forever save it to my 'virtual memory' for example when learning code for the first time it could be easy to mix up standards between the different programming languages, but with MyBrain you can always be sure your information is correct.

 FEATURES
 When using MyBrain you will be able to activate your own brain and create folders (or genres). Within those folders you will be able to make individual files called Wrinkles. It is said when you learn something new you gain an extra wrinkle on your brain. If you have information that you dont want to share publically on the MyBrain app, no worries! you have the option of making your post public so people can learn from your experiences or private for the things you'd like to keep to yourself.

 HOW IT WAS MADE
 MyBrain was created with a Ruby-on-Rails backend SQLite database, and a  React, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML front-end. I also used JWIT for user Authentication.

 FINAL WORDS
 Thank you again for checking my project out feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-herrera-aka-algorithmicjason/ and go and create yourself some new wrinkles!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
